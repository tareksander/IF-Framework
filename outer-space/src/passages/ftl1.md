The ship enters FTL flight, and there's finally some quiet for you.
You fix up the ship a bit without haste, then go into the pilot seat and stare out into the shifting red fog that's always visible during FTL flight.

You reminisce about the past and what this ship has been through together with you.
It was at the brink of falling apart many times, but you always managed to fix it up.

You are pulled from your thought when the red fog fades into the blackness of space: <iff-link passage="front">The FTL flight has ended, and your work begins again</iff-link>.
