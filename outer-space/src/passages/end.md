You arrive at the battlefield. You carefully navigate to one of the nearest wreckages and exit your airlock.
As expected, the ship's airlocks don't work anymore without power.
The other side of the ship is fully melted, so there's no way in from there, too.
You use your heavy laser cutter to gradually cut through the hull.

The inside is in rather pristine condition: Only the other side that likely contained the ship's command room got melted.
The survivors of this side probably left with escape pods, that may or may not have been shot down.

You make your way to the engine room, because other heavy machinery is often located there as well as the generator, for short high-power cables.
You don't believe your eyes: There's an apparently completely intact FTL drive, one for this size of a ship is sure to make you a hefty sum.

You begin by cutting the ground around where the drive is welded in, and proceed to cut through the walls until you're outside again.
Then you tie the drive to your ship so it's still in range of your own FTL drive and plate it with the hull you've cut out to save it from meteorites.

You continue to loot the other ships, but none are in as got as a condition as this. Soon your ship is filled to the brim with scrap and components again, and you instruct your navigation computer to route you to the nearest market planet. Maybe you'll be able to upgrade your reactor and afford a small shield generator now, so that you don't have to worry about meteorites anymore.

The End.
