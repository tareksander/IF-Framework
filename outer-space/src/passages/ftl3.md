The ship enters FTL flight, and there's finally some quiet for you.
You fix up the ship a bit without haste, then go into the pilot seat and stare out into the shifting red fog that's always visible during FTL flight.

This time your thoughts stay in the here and now, or rather in the future. You think about what things you might loot from the battlefield.
Maybe another shield generator? Though those tend to burn out from heavy fire, so that's unlikely

You are pulled from your thought when the red fog fades into the blackness of space: <iff-link passage="end">The FTL flight has ended, and your work begins again</iff-link>.
