The ship enters FTL flight, and there's finally some quiet for you.
You fix up the ship a bit without haste, then go into the pilot seat and stare out into the shifting red fog that's always visible during FTL flight.

You remember your many trades with foreign species: Most of them gave you a bad price (in your opinion) for what you salvaged, but there are a few key trades where you made a great deal. Like one time you sold a completely intact shield generator that would have sucked up too much power for your ship anyways and got your current navigation computer. At the time, it was a threefold upgrade for you.

You are pulled from your thought when the red fog fades into the blackness of space: <iff-link passage="front">The FTL flight has ended, and your work begins again</iff-link>.
