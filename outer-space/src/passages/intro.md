You're a space vulture: You feed off the remains of other ships to repair yours and sell what you don't need.
It doesn't make much, but makes a living. Mostly.

Currently, things are not goings so well. The last 2 battlegrounds you visited have already been plundered, and your ship, the Cantlery, is slowly falling apart, as always.
You estimate there will be 3 FTL flight stages until you reach the next wreckage field, which is hopefully still fresh.
Fewer FTL stages would be risky, as your old navigation computer isn't able to accurately compute such long flights.
It has trouble even with smaller FTL flights: It always needs a while to compute the next one.

You are distracted in your thoughts by a sudden a hissing noise: The oxygen generator on your space suit (which you always wear, for safety) is broken again.
You get up from your pilot seat and go to your workbench in the midsection to fix it and hastily put the suit back on.
